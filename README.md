# ConnectFour
My attempt to create a game of connect four that has a computer opponent that can make calculated decisions on how to win.

Standard level the computer tries to block the player from winning.

Cunning level the computer tries to win as well as block the player from winning.

The Stack is Angular 2.5 and hosted at http://healthy-hub-client.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/

The Web Api is .net core hosted on Azure with a sql server on azure as well to hold winning records.
